# Audience
Developers with no or little experience in (modern) Java Web Application Development

# Prerequisites
Familiarity with the following topics:
- HTTP REST
- Logging
- Persistence
- Cloud Platforms

# Objective
Write a web application using the Cloud Application Programming Model and deploy it in the cloud. Test your abilities and identify any missing knowledge by working through the exercises, where you will:
- use CAP services to expose data of entities via an OData endpoint
- use CAP's Spring integration to create meaningful logging
- use CDL (Conceptual Definition Language) to define data models
- use CQL (CDS Query Language) statement builders to persist and retrieve data from the database in a lightweight manner without having to write SQL

# Wait, but why?
CAP is a framework of languages, libraries and tools for building enterprise-grade cloud applications. CAP abstracts away many low-level functions that you would have to deal with otherwise. 

Those include:
- Data modeling
- Service definition modeling
- REST endpoint exposure

You will need to learn how to use the main CAP features to be able to create your own CAP web applications.
